> ### Unfortunately, Qubit has reached end-of-life.
> #### A message from the creator:
> Hi everyone,
> Qubit is a dead project. I no longer am able to find time to work on it and it's just as much of a project as my thousands of other ones I never finish. I'm tremendously thankful to a select few people who have done everything they can to keep the project alive while I sit back and watch. However, after confrontation, the public build of Qubit will no longer be publicly accessible 24/7. In short, Qubit is going on a long to permanent hiatus.

## Documentation
Some things are documented here. Most documentation is temporary and for ambitious closed alpha/beta testers; it may not be 100% up to date, but it will get the point across nicely.
