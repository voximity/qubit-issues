**Profiles**

Profiles are a big part of the Qubit bot, letting you costumize your profile with a biograph and a status.
It also displays your current amount of <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qgQrp1k.png" width="24px"/> at the time, your name with your hashtag,
your Qubit level and experience and your reputation.
Profiles are useful for expressing yourself, updating the people around you in a way that is nicely laid out and convenient,

**Commands**

  The profile command is used to display your own profile.
    
    \profile [username]

      Example : "\profile @FakeUser#2534" will give you the profile of FakeUser

      This subcommand will set your biography, or bio, on your profile. This text can be up to 280 characters long.
      The profile bio also supports standard emojies, bold and italic text, crossout and link embedding. 
      Link embedding can be done by writting your link button in between squared brackets 
      immediatly followed by your link contained in normal brackets [button](http://link.com)

      Example: "\profile Bio Hi my name is FakeUser!" will set your bio to display "Hi my name is FakeUser!"
      
    \profile status <content>
      The status subcommand sets the status part of your profile. The status is meant for a shorter description of how you are
      at the moment but can be used in any way you want. Besides the character limit being 140 the same rules apply for status as do for bios
      
      Example: "\profile status Feeling great mate!" will set your status to display "Feeling great mate!"
